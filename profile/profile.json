  "summary": "I recently graduated from a 4-year program at Ryerson University and received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In school, I undertook a concentration in Software Engineering. Topics in the field I am driven by are algorithm and data structure design and optimization, and writing clean, readable code. I believe that my expertise and passion will lead me to success in this industry.\nDuring my years in school, some of the most important lessons I learned were through interactions and collaboration with classmates. It was during group projects that I learned the importance of high-level communication. Especially in a team environment, I hold transparency, being able to take fault, and being willing to ask for and receive help as of the highest value.\nAt this point in my career, I'm open to exploring new opportunities. I have confidence in my strength in analyzing problems and designing algorithms to solve them. It would be my dream come true to contribute to a distinguished codebase as a major milestone for one of the greatest pursuits of my life: a career in cutting-edge tech."
