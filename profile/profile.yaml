# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I recently graduated from a 4-year program at Ryerson University and received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In school, I undertook a concentration in Software Engineering. Topics in the field I am driven by are algorithm and data structure design and optimization, and writing clean, readable code. I believe that my expertise and passion will lead me to success in this industry.

During my years in school, some of the most important lessons I learned were through interactions and collaboration with classmates. It was during group projects that I learned the importance of high-level communication. Especially in a team environment, I hold transparency, being able to take fault, and being willing to ask for and receive help as of the highest value.

At this point in my career, I'm open to exploring new opportunities. I have confidence in my strength in analyzing problems and designing algorithms to solve them. It would be my dream come true to contribute to a distinguished codebase as a major milestone for one of the greatest pursuits of my life: a career in cutting-edge tech."

    description: Developed an app for automated collection of system specifications and resource usage of a node in a Linux server cluster. Implemented info collection scripts in Bash, designed PostgreSQl database, and wrote SQL script for compiling and fetching useful aggregate information. Tested app manually on remote CentOS nodes; input was fed by hand and tested against valid and invalid input, with all tests passing. Deployed the app with Docker to contain the PostgreSQL database, and crontab set up to periodically execute Bash scripts.
